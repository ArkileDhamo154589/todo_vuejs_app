# Vue 3 To-Do App
This is a simple Vue 3 project that allows users to manage their to-do lists without the need for a database. Users can add their names (which will later be integrated with user login functionality). Additionally, users can select categories, such as "Work" or "Home," to categorize their to-dos. The app also provides the ability to mark to-dos as complete and delete them.

# Features
User Name: Users can enter their names when using the app. In future updates, this will be integrated with user authentication.

Category Selection: Users can categorize their to-dos as either "Work" or "Home" (or other custom categories in future updates).

To-Do Management: Users can create, edit, complete, and delete to-dos.

# Usage
 Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/vue3-todo-app.git](https://github.com/ArkileDhamo154589/todo_vuejs_app)

 Navigate to the project directory: cd vue3-todo-app

 Install the required dependencies: npm install
 Run the development server:  npm run serve.

# Future Enhancements
 In future updates, the following features will be added to enhance the app's functionality:

 Custom Categories: Users will have the ability to create and manage their own categories for better organization.

 Deadline Setting: Users will be able to set deadlines for their to-dos to prioritize tasks effectively.
